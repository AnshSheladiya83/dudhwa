                    Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is one of the last remains of once vastly spread Himalayan Terai. Being a threatened habitat itself, the beings it harbour are mostly rare and uncommon to the fragmented and ever reducing areas of vast wilderness of the country.

                    <span className="bold-text">Dudhwa Tiger Reserve</span> comprises the Dudhwa National Park, Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, and Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary. The tiger reserve includes fragments of the three large forests mentioned above in an area of 2201.77 sq km. Supported by Mohana River on the Northern boundary and shaarda river on south along with gerwa river in katarniaghat with a series of last remained oxbow lakes and marshy grasslands, dry riverine grasslands and dense moist deciduous Â sal woodlands dudhwa becomes a biodiversity hotspot for flora and fauna each interconnected under food chains and food webs of different niches. The challenging landscape makes most of the parts of DTR difficult to access even on foot during the monsoons. A rainbow of colours are to be found as butterflies, insects, flowers embed in dark green hues of woodland and clear sky.
